## MU Puzzle

The MU puzzle is a formal system that Hofstadter has us play with to get familiar with formal systems. 

>Such strings, producible by the rules, are
>called theorems. The term "theorem" has, of course, a common usage in
>mathematics which is quite different from this one. 
>It means some statement in ordinary language which has been proven to be true by a rigorous
>argument, such as Zeno's Theorem about the "unexistence" of motion, or
>Euclid's Theorem about the infinitude of primes. But in formal systems,
>theorems need not be thought of as statements-they are merely strings of
>symbols. And instead of being proven, theorems are merely produced, as ifby

In order to code this formal stystem I am writing my own replacement algorithm for rule 3 and rule 4, 
as replace() or regex would only catch one see previous code.

It really seems that built in replace() is more for natural languages in these languages you rarely need to pick every set of three out of four or more identical characters.

This actually highlights the character of formal languages and mechanical manipulation. So it's fitting that
I must use a lower level approach to capture that character and get all the groups.

Here is some example code. Of this approach for rule  3: replace any 'III' with 'U'

```python
strlst=[]

s='MIIIIIIII'
count=0

for i in range(len(s)-2):
    
    if s[i]=='I' and s[i+1] == 'I' and s[i+2]=='I':
        count+=1
        l = list(s)
        l[i] = "U"
        l[i+1] = ""
        l[i+2] =""
        strlst.append("".join(l))
        
        
        
print(count,strlst,len(strlst))

# >> 6 ['MUIIIII', 'MIUIIII', 'MIIUIII', 'MIIIUII', 'MIIIIUI', 'MIIIIIU'] 6
````
